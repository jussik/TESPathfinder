# TESPathfinder

A web application for finding the quickest way to travel around Vvardenfell in _The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind_.

## Todo

1. Enable/disable features from affecting path calculation
1. Text seach
1. Non-transport related places (towns, ruins etc.)
1. Pretty interface

## Build

Includes Visual Studio 2015 solution but works just as well without it. (TODO: add gulpfile)

Compile ts/*.ts into js/ (e.g. with tsc, TODO: instructions).
