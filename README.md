# TESPathfinder

A web application for finding the quickest way to travel around Vvardenfell in _The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind_.

## Todo

1. Better search, datalist isn't cutting it
1. Collapsible sections for search, options and navigation instructions
1. Relative font sizes for mobile
1. Ability to save options in localStorage
1. Snazzy UX!
1. Buzzwords!

## Build

Includes Visual Studio 2015 solution but works just as well without it. (TODO: add gulpfile)

Compile ts/*.ts into js/ (e.g. with tsc, TODO: instructions).
