# TESPathfinder

A web application for finding the quickest way to travel around Vvardenfell in _The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind_.

## Todo

1. Arrow keys functionality for context menu/search results
1. Better features UI
1. Make scrolling work on IE
1. Make it all work better on mobile
1. Ability to save options in localStorage

## Build

Includes Visual Studio 2015 solution but works just as well without it. (TODO: add gulpfile)

Compile ts/*.ts into js/ (e.g. with tsc, TODO: instructions).
