# TESPathfinder

A web application for finding the quickest way to travel around Vvardenfell in _The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind_.

## Todo

1. Arrow keys functionality for context menu/search results
1. Better features UI
1. Make scrolling work on IE
1. Make it all work better on mobile
1. Ability to save options in localStorage

## Build

You'll need `npm`,  for example from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Install gulp globally from a terminal: `npm i -g gulp`  
Install build dependencies: `npm i`  
Build app: `gulp`

If you don't have a web server, run `npm i -g http-server` and start it using `http-server`.
