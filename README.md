# TESPathfinder

A web application for finding the quickest way to travel around Vvardenfell in _The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind_.

Implemented in Typescript using Angular 2.

## Build

Includes Visual Studio 2015 solution but works just as well without it. (TODO: add gulpfile)

Compile ts/*.ts into js/ (e.g. with tsc, TODO: instructions), drop it on a server and you're ready to go.
